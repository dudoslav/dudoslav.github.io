		Hi, my name is Dušan Baran. This website is about my past and current projects. 
		It will start with basic ones because they were my first project and maybe the last ones will 
		be more complicated.
		</p>

		<p class="otext">
		My first project is called "DudEngine". Yea.. like "CryEngine" or "SourceEngine". When I was 16 
		I wanted to create my own 3D graphics but I had no idea how to use OpenGL or DirectX. So I used something 
		much harder ... MATH!! Yea I did all rendering using software so it was slow.. But it worked.
		</p>
		<p class="wtext">
		After this project I tried creating game close to dwarf fortress in pascal (Delphi, Lazarus) and java, 
		but I couldn't finish it.
		</p>

		As time passed summer holidays were closer and closer. I love summer holidays because I can create my own 
		projects and I have enough time to finish them. But this year it was different. I met 
		another programmer, his name is Tomáš Jašek (<a href="http://tomsik68.github.io/jekyll/update/webpage/blog/homepage/website/2014/05/16/new-home.html" style="color:#FF692E">Tomsik68</a>). 
		Together we decided to create 3D voxel based tower defence game called 
		"<a href="https://github.com/tomsik68/DefendIt" style="color:#FF692E">DefendIT!</a>". But it failed because 
		we could not maintain stable 60fps. But at least we learned a lot.
		</p>
		<a href="http://dudoslav.github.io/DuXel/" style="float:right"><img src="img/duxel_icon.ico" width="70em" height="70em"/></a>
		<p class="wtext">
		School came back and I had to choose some seminar work. So I did. I wanted to create pixel graphics editor that 
		would make it easier for me to create pixelated games. And "DuXel" was born. It is pretty simple, but it's 
		really slow, because I was still not a good programmer. But I liked the theme of it, icon, nearly everything.
		</p>
		<p class="otext">
		Currently I am working with Jašek to create remake of "Tunneler" but with network multiplayer. It is going well 
		but it's really hard and there are many things to learn. But I really want to finish this one.
